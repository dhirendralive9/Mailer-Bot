# Mailer-Bot

<b>09-04-2022</b>: So we have the structure on how the bot is going to intake the data which is essential for the operation of the mailer-bot.\n
The new structure is much more efficient when it comes to intaking much more data in few seconds as compared as compared with the older structure 
which was taking a lot more time like hours to send data. Now, we should focus to make sure that data which is recived is appropiate and its ready to get in action. 

<b>11-04-2022</b>: We have successfully added the /error , /status and /start route. More tesing needed. We can start working on mailer module now.
